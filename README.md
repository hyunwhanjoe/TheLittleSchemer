# TheLittleSchemer
Notes from the book [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262560993/the-little-schemer/) 4th edition.  
I'm currently relearning Scheme (lisp dialect) from 2015, where I finished up to chapter 4 in the book.  
I used DrRacket with the sicp package to run the code in the book.  

# Lisp quotes
LISP is worth learning for a different reason — the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot. - [Eric S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)  

Yes, that was the big revelation to me when I was in graduate school—when I finally understood that the half page of code on the bottom of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5 manual was Lisp in itself. These were “Maxwell’s Equations of Software!” This is the whole world of programming in a few lines that I can put my hand over. - [Alan Kay](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523)
