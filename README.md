# TheLittleSchemer
Notes from the book [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262560993/the-little-schemer/) 4th edition.  
I'm currently relearning Scheme (lisp dialect) from 2015, where I finished up to chapter 4 in the book.  
I used DrRacket with the sicp package to run the code in the book.
